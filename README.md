## 📸 Test Recording & Screenshots

To enable screenshots or video recording, configure your `playwright.config.js` or specify in individual tests using
`test.use`.

```js
use: {
      // screenshot: 'only-on-failure', // options: 'on', 'off', 'only-on-failure'
      // video: 'on',                   // options: 'on', 'off', 'only-on-failure'
}
```

Uncomment and adjust based on your use case.
